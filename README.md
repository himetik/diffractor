> 'gendiff' can make a difference!

<br/>

`gendiff` is a command-line application that compares two files and generates the difference between them. 
The application supports files in JSON and YAML formats and provides three output formats for displaying the differences: stylish, plain, and json.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Features

 - File Comparison: Compares two files and identifies the differences between them.
 - Supported Formats: Works with files in JSON and YAML (YML) formats.
 - Output Formats: Displays the differences in three different formats:
   - Stylish: A nested format that shows the differences in a hierarchical structure.
   - Plain: A plain text format that shows the differences in a straightforward, linear way.
   - JSON: A JSON format that outputs the differences as a JSON object.

### üîå Installation

> It is recommended to use a virtual environment

1. **Well, this is how you can start the virtual environment**
(let's call it, for example, bubble) **if you have Python3 installed.**

```bash
python3 -m venv bubble
source bubble/bin/activate
```

2. **Clone the repository and then go into it:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:himetik/python-project-50.git
cd python-project-50
```

3. **Install the app with just one command:**

```bash
make run
```

### üïπÔ∏è Use 'gendiff' to Compare Two JSON/YAML Files

- **Stylish Format (default)**: 
  Displays the differences in a human-readable format.

```bash
gendiff -f stylish first.yaml second.yml
```

- **Plain Format**: 
  Shows the differences in a plain text format.

```bash
gendiff -f plain first.json second.json
```

- **JSON Format**: 
  Outputs the differences in JSON.

```bash
